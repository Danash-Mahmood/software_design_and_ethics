#Software Design 

##Cohesion


Cohesion refers to the degree to which units of software systems belong together. So we can think of it hasd a measure for how closley related the responsibilites of a software unit is. In our system design we want high cohesion, i.e. have classes that are responsible for something to contain all the methods for that responsibility. A class that had database responsivbiliy as well as user interface responsibility would be low cohesion. 


##Coupling

Coupling is the measure of dependancy of software systems with each other.
