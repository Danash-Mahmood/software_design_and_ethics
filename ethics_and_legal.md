#Legal and Ethics


### This document will review 3 businesses and their approach to GDPR and answer the following questions:

-Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

-What are the ethical concerns with the company's propasal?

-What could the company do to address these issues?



##BankingCorp

###Legal Concerns

The company could be breaking GDPR laws specifically recital 69 (Right to Object) which states 

>'Where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.'
>

So at present they are not giving the users the ability to opt out of the payday loan company seeing their data which violates this area of GDPR.

###Ethical Concerns

The ethical concerns for BankingCorp is assessing how ethical it is to be advertsising payday loans to vunerable people who are already struggling to pay their credit card bills. It could be viewed as exploiting/predatory behaviour toward people with no other option for financial gain (financial gain from high interests rates on a loan or seizing assets if the loan is defaulted).

###Adressing Issues

Firstly BankingCorp need to implement an opt out from the payday loan service **before** giving the payday loan company accsess to data. This should be clearly visible on their banking app and all users should be propmpted to opt in or out of this service before being able to accsess the app.

Also they should use a different payday loan provider with better publicity/lower interest rates and options before defaulting.


##Treasure Hunters

This business appears to not have any legal or ethical concerns by appropriate business practises.




##Friends.com


###Ethical concerns 
With the premium service it could set a financial barrier for people who are lonely which could be seen as a bad practise.

Some users may be fine with location being used for friends but not with targeted ads.

Predators could exploit the app by targeting lonely people.


###Adressing issues
Having a free way of unlocking premium for a set amount of time by watching a set amount of full screen ads.

Having an opt out of targeted ads and only show generic ads for people who opt out.

Have a safety feature for reporting users who have made people uncomfortable etc.
